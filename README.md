## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It is a reference model that helps understand how data moves from one system to another.

---

## OSI Model Layers

The OSI model consists of the following **seven layers**:

1. Application Layer  
2. Presentation Layer  
3. Session Layer  
4. Transport Layer  
5. Network Layer  
6. Data Link Layer  
7. Physical Layer

## Layer-wise Explanation and Cloud Computing Relation

### Layer 7 – Application Layer

This layer provides network services directly to the user.

**Protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS

**Cloud Relation:** Used by cloud applications, web services, and cloud management consoles.

---

### Layer 6 – Presentation Layer

This layer is responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression.

**Cloud Relation:** Provides secure communication in cloud services using encryption such as SSL/TLS.

---

### Layer 5 – Session Layer

This layer manages sessions between communicating systems.

**Cloud Relation:** Maintains user sessions and connections in cloud applications.

---

### Layer 4 – Transport Layer

This layer ensures data is delivered reliably or quickly between systems.

**Protocols:** TCP, UDP

**Cloud Relation:** Used for data transmission between cloud servers and users.

---

### Layer 3 – Network Layer

This layer handles routing and IP addressing.

**Cloud Relation:** Used in cloud networking for VPCs, subnets, and routing.

---

### Layer 2 – Data Link Layer

This layer provides node-to-node data transfer and switching.

**Cloud Relation:** Used for communication between virtual machines within the same network.

---

### Layer 1 – Physical Layer

This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data.

**Cloud Relation:** Includes physical servers and networking hardware in cloud data centers.

---

## Networking Concepts Related to OSI Model

- **Switching:** Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- **Routing:** Network Layer (Layer 3)
- **Handshakes:** Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- **IP Addressing:** Network Layer (Layer 3)

## Conclusion

The OSI model helps understand network communication by dividing it into seven layers. In cloud computing, the OSI model is used to design, manage, and troubleshoot cloud-based network architectures.
